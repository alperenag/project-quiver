# 1. **Introduction**

The purpose of Project Quiver is to design and manufacture a practical multi-purpose multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle. This aligns with Arrow’s mission of developing manned and unmanned aircraft for the commercial aviation market while generating new concepts in manufacturing, materials science, structural design, and related technologies. Equipped with internet native collaborators and Web3 infrastructure, Arrow aims to break up the lack of innovation in the global drone market.   

This aircraft is designed to perform typical light UAV missions. The design concept is: compact and portable, easy to manufacture, easy to maintain, highly reliable, highly adaptable, and expandable.

The First Prototype (PT1) of Project Quiver will feature:
- A common quadcopter layout to ensure energy efficiency and simplified structure.
- Maximum mission load of 25 kg. Considering the safety factor, the designated maximum thrust force is about 45 to 50 kg.
- Foldable motor beams and propellers for ease of storage and transportation.
- Standardized quick-release mission equipment pylon (Attachment interface).
- Digital autopilot system assisted features, such as GNSS-assist hovering, waypoint missions, radar altimeter, etc.
- FPV camera with video transmission to assist pilot decision and various mission actions.
- Powered with 14-cell LiHV smart battery and advanced main power connectors commonly used by heavy drones.
- CAN bus for signal communication to avoid electromagnetic interference that traditional non-differential signals such as PWM may be subject to.
- Using digitalized sensor communication to monitor more components, such as battery cell temperature and ESC temperature.
- ~~Using integrated thrust terminal to improve the reliability and design convenience of the thrust system, also for easier sourcing, installing and initial testing.~~
- single source, fully integrated motor arm with propulsion system for easier sourcing, installation, and testing. 
- Implement testbed PDB and contactor from Project Feather for safe operation of the power distribution system.

Based on these characteristics, Project Quiver will also compete with other UAVs in the market in terms of parameters such as endurance, empty weight ratio, open source development, and mission equipment. It's also expected to gradually introduce more advanced designs including but not limited to the following items in future prototypes: The following features will be introduced in future prototypes:

# 4. **Mission Performance**

Below is a mission performance analysis of maximum possible flight time for two missions: Surveillance and Waypoint Missions both under a Tattu 3.5 14S LiHV 30 Ah battery.

Key assumptions:

- **Usable Battery**: 21.6 Ah (after 2C derating to ~27 Ah, then a 20% reserve).  
- **Propulsion**: 4 Hobbywing X6 Plus motors.  
- **Mission Legs**: short, fixed‐time take‐off, climb, descent, landing; the remaining time is the main mission leg.
- **Real-World Effects**: Climb rates, aerodynamic efficiency, battery health, and environmental conditions do not affect the performance.  

## 4.1. Surveillance Mission

In this mission, the aircraft hovers with 20 kg MTOW without any payload, using its camera for surveillance.

### 4.1.1. Current Requirements

- Hover Current (20 kg): ~40.9 A (estimated from thrust‐vs‐current data of Hobbywing X6 Plus).  
- Take‐Off / Climb (110%): ~48.6 A  
- Descent (90%): ~35.5 A  
- Landing (100%): ~40.9 A

- Take‐off: 0.5 min  
- Climb: 1.5 min  
- Descent: 1.0 min  
- Landing: 1.0 min  

Convert each to hours and multiply by current to get amp‐hours.

1. **Take‐off (0.5 min)**  
   - 0.5 min = 0.0083 hr  
   - 48.6 A × 0.0083 hr ≈ 0.40 Ah  

2. **Climb (1.5 min)**  
   - 1.5 min = 0.025 hr  
   - 48.6 A × 0.025 hr = 1.22 Ah  

3. **Descent (1.0 min)**  
   - 1.0 min = 0.0167 hr  
   - 35.5 A × 0.0167 hr ≈ 0.59 Ah  

4. **Landing (1.0 min)**  
   - 1.0 min = 0.0167 hr  
   - 40.9 A × 0.0167 hr ≈ 0.68 Ah  

Sum of non‐mission legs = **2.89 Ah**.

### 4.1.3. Maximum Hover Duration

Remaining capacity for hover = 21.6 Ah − 2.89 Ah = **18.71 Ah**.  
At 40.9 A (hover), available hover time = 18.71 Ah ÷ 40.9 A ≈ **0.457 hr** = ~27.4 min.

**Total Surveillance Flight Time**  
- Non‐mission legs: 0.5 + 1.5 + 1.0 + 1.0 = 4.0 min  
- Hover: ~27.4 min  
- **Overall**: ~31.4 min  

## 4.2. Waypoint Mission

In this mission, the aircraft travels with 25 kg MTOW between waypoints. The power consumption for forward flight is assumed as 120% of hover.

### 4.2.1. Current Requirements

- Hover Current (25 kg): ~57.5 A  
- Forward Flight (120%): ~69 A
- Take‐Off/Climb (110%): ~66.5 A  
- Descent (90%): ~49.9 A  
- Landing (100%): ~57.5 A

### 4.2.2. Mission Leg Times

- Take‐off: 1.0 min  
- Climb: 2.0 min  
- Descent: 1.0 min  
- Landing: 1.0 min  

1. **Take‐off (1.0 min)**  
   - 1.0 min = 0.0167 hr  
   - 66.5 A × 0.0167 hr ≈ 1.11 Ah  

2. **Climb (2.0 min)**  
   - 2.0 min = 0.0333 hr  
   - 66.5 A × 0.0333 hr ≈ 2.22 Ah  

3. **Descent (1.0 min)**  
   - 1.0 min = 0.0167 hr  
   - 49.9 A × 0.0167 hr ≈ 0.83 Ah  

4. **Landing (1.0 min)**  
   - 1.0 min = 0.0167 hr  
   - 57.5 A × 0.0167 hr ≈ 0.96 Ah  

Sum of these legs = **5.12 Ah**.

### 4.2.3. Maximum Forward‐Flight Duration

Remaining capacity for forward flight = 21.6 Ah − 5.12 Ah = **16.48 Ah**.  
At 69 A, flight time = 16.48 Ah ÷ 69 A ≈ **0.239 hr** = ~14.3 min.

**Total Loiter Flight Time**  
- Non‐mission legs: 1.0 + 2.0 + 1.0 + 1.0 = 5.0 min  
- Forward flight: ~14.3 min  
- **Overall**: ~19.3 min

## 4.3. Summary

Under ideal conditions, Project Quiver PT1 achieves a total flight time of approximately 31.4 minutes for surveillance missions at 20 kg MTOW, including about 27.4 minutes of hover. For waypoint missions at the full 25 kg MTOW, total flight time is around 19.3 minutes, with roughly 14.3 minutes of forward flight. Both mission scenarios incorporate a 20% battery reserve to ensure operational safety. Actual performance may vary due to environmental conditions and operational factors.

# 5. **Flight Mechanics**

This section presents the flight mechanics analysis of Project Quiver, with a focus on assessing its dynamic behavior, stability characteristics, and control performance under operational loading conditions. The aircraft has a maximum MTOW of 25 kg, and two critical configurations were evaluated:

- **No Payload Configuration (18 kg):** Vehicle equipped with propulsion system, avionics, and battery, but without any payload modules.
- **With Brush Bullet Dispenser (22 kg):** Includes a 4 kg payload module mounted at (0, 0, -40 cm) relative to the center of gravity, simulating an operational mission loadout.

A simulation environment based on MATLAB Simulink (adapted from the asbQuadcopter model) was developed to characterize the system response. The model incorporates a cascaded PID controller structure for attitude and altitude stabilization.

## 5.1 Static and Dynamic Stability Analysis

### 5.1.1 Static Stability

Static stability describes the initial tendency of the vehicle to return to equilibrium following a small disturbance.

- **Center of Gravity (CG) Effects:**  
  - In the no payload configuration, the CG is closely aligned with the vehicle’s geometric center, resulting in neutral static stability in roll and pitch.  
  - In the brush bullet dispenser configuration, the CG is shifted downward, which contributes to improved pendulum-like passive stability, but at the cost of increased rotational inertia.

- **Static Margin:**  
  - The vertical CG offset in the payload configuration increases the static margin, enhancing stability in hover but reducing control responsiveness.

### 5.1.2 Dynamic Stability

Dynamic stability pertains to the time-dependent response of the system to disturbances.

- **Eigenvalue Analysis:**  
  - Both configurations exhibit eigenvalues with negative real parts, indicating asymptotic stability.  
  - The brush bullet dispenser configuration shows reduced damping ratios and lower natural frequencies due to increased inertia, leading to longer settling times.

- **Estimated Damping Ratios (ζ):**  
  - No Payload: 0.65 – 0.8  
  - With Brush Bullet Dispenser: 0.5 – 0.6

- **Time-to-Half (τₕ):**  
  - No Payload: 0.8 – 1.2 s  
  - With Brush Bullet Dispenser: 1.4 – 1.8 s

- **Phugoid and Oscillatory Modes:**  
  - Both configurations exhibit mild phugoid-like modes due to coupling between pitch and vertical motion, with greater amplitude and period in the payload configuration.

## 5.2 Trim Analysis

Trim conditions represent the steady-state control inputs required to maintain hover.

- **Hover Thrust per Motor:**  
  - No Payload: ~4.5 kgf/motor  
  - With Brush Bullet Dispenser: ~5.5 kgf/motor

- **Trim Attitude Angles:**  
  - No Payload: < 0.5° in all axes  
  - With Brush Bullet Dispenser: Requires a forward pitch trim of approximately 0.9° due to the CG offset

- **Power Margin:**  
  - No Payload: ~45% thrust reserve  
  - With Brush Bullet Dispenser: ~30%, approaching the control authority limits under aggressive conditions

## 5.3 Control Response and Maneuverability

System responsiveness was evaluated via step response analysis and control effort metrics.

### 5.3.1 Step Response Characteristics
The actual control architecture and gains in Ardupilot were not replicated in the Simulink model, instead, a simplified cascaded PID controller was employed. These values do not represent the actual Ardupilot controller performance, rather, result of the tuned cascaded PID system.

- **Rise Time (10–90%):**  
  - No Payload: ~0.45 s  
  - With Brush Bullet Dispenser: ~0.65 s

- **Settling Time (±2%):**  
  - No Payload: ~1.2 s
  - With Brush Bullet Dispenser: ~1.8 s

- **Overshoot:**  
  - No Payload: ~5%  
  - With Brush Bullet Dispenser: ~12%

### 5.3.2 Control Effort and Authority

- **Required Control Effort in Pitch Maneuvers:**  
  - No Payload: ~15% of available motor thrust  
  - With Brush Bullet Dispenser: ~22%, increasing actuator workload

- **Motor Saturation Risk:**  
  - In the payload configuration, motor commands approach 85% of maximum thrust during aggressive inputs, reducing margin for disturbance rejection or emergency maneuvers

## 5.4 Lateral-Directional Stability

- **Cross-Axis Coupling:**  
  - Slight increase in roll-yaw coupling observed in the brush bullet dispenser configuration due to the lower CG, but remains within controllable limits.

- **Spiral Mode and Longitudinal Coupling:**  
  - No divergent spiral or unstable longitudinal modes detected in either configuration.

## 5.5 Disturbance Rejection Performance

### 5.5.1 Wind Gust Response (Lateral)

- **Simulated Wind Input:** Step disturbance of 5 m/s applied laterally  
- **Recovery Time:**  
  - No Payload: ~1.5 s  
  - With Brush Bullet Dispenser: ~3.2 s, with greater drift before correction

### 5.5.2 Vertical Gust Response

- **Simulated Vertical Gust:** ±2 m/s impulse  
- **Altitude Excursion:**  
  - No Payload: ~15 cm  
  - With Brush Bullet Dispenser: ~25 cm

## 5.6 Conclusions

- Both configurations exhibit stable dynamic behavior, but the payload configuration is slower to respond and more susceptible to disturbances due to increased mass and inertia.
- The control authority in the payload configuration is significantly reduced, and motor saturation may occur under high-demand maneuvers.
- Disturbance rejection performance is degraded in the payload configuration, requiring longer recovery times.
- Hover and trim characteristics remain within acceptable ranges, but controller gains may require re-tuning for payload missions to improve damping and responsiveness.

# 7. **Electrical System**

This section provides a comprehensive overview of the electrical design and integration work carried out for the V1 prototype of Project Quiver. It details the planning, layout, and execution of the power and signal systems essential for the first iteration fo Project Quiver, which is engineered to deploy a brush bullet payload. The report outlines power and signal layouts, block diagrams, and wiring schematics, along with an in-depth review of the selected components—from battery systems and power distribution boards to flight controllers and ESCs. Finally, it covers critical considerations such as wiring methods, connector selection, and the integration of control signals via Arduino and Pixhawk interfaces.

### 7.1 System Design and Layout

#### Image 1: Power Layout

#### Image 2: Signal Layout

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0eddcddc-ba53-4643-984d-880e7c772a90)


The electrical power layout is divided into two sections. One line dedicated to providing HV power to the ESCs via contactor control on the Power PCB. Additionally, it provides power to the PCB for all of the propulsion system and internal components. 
The second line is providing HV to the UBEC to give steady and reliable power to the flight controller, telemetry air unit, and additional peripherals. The second line has a physical switch on the positive line before the UBEC to give the user control over power going to the flight controller. 

The signal layout can be thought of mainly two sections, the ESCs to the flight controller and the PCB to the flight controller. These two sections will operate on separate CAN lines. The ESCs will connect to the flight controller's CAN 1 and use the DroneCAN protocol. The battery (currently unused) and the radar altimeter will connect to the CAN2 port. The only additional signal being used will be two aux GPIO signals coming from the pixhawk to the PCB for relay and contactor control

#### Pre-charge and contactor control 

The [contactor (pg.11) ](https://www.dkxn-wx.com/uploadfile/202406/chongdianzhuangen.pdf) on the PCB controls the HV output going to the ESCs. It is controlled by the user via a toggle switch on their RC that instructs the flight controller to send a signal to the on board Arduino. This allows the user to safely disconnect the power to the ESCs and motor in the case of an emergency or at the end of operation. 
On the PCB, the contactor works in hand with a pre-charge circuit for safe operation. The pre-charge allows the capacitor on the ESCs to be partially filled and prevents a large in rush current once the contactor is closed. This is important to mitigate any electrical arcing and damaging the ESCs. Below is a brief explanation of how the pre-charge and contactor control is handled. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd9126dc-1bea-4fef-b471-74b604b15c6c)

- Arduino sends signal to [pre-charge relay (K1) ](https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/240/media-3323785.pdf) when it recieves command from flight controller for "contactor close"
  - this allows for a low current to pass through multiple [pre-charge resistors (R1-R3)](https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/54/pwr163-777985.pdf), bypassing the contactor, to the ESCs
  - after 5 seconds, the Arduino sends signal to the [contactor relay (K2)](https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/240/media-3323426.pdf), effectivly closing the contactor
  - the precharge is then turned off 


#### Arduino
[Arduino MKR WIFI 1010](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/mkr-wifi-1010/)

- used to send a timed enable signal for the pre-charge circuit
- after a short period, enable signal sent to close contactor

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b93a61c9-8da2-4238-8c58-437d632dc7aa)

The KDE UBEC "allows for clean, voltage-regulated power for critical flight electronics and peripheral equipment (including 12V aerial photography and high-end UAS equipment)". The UBEC was added to avoid having a secondary power supply to the flight controller and any peripheral systems. The 12V regulator on the PCB would experience too much load if it attempted to power the PCB, brush bullet, and flight controller. Using a UBEC is an easy integration and allows for a clean 12V power delivery to mission critical components. 

A toggle switched was placed on the positive lead going to the UBEC from the battery to give the user manual control over the power flowing through the UBEC to the flight controller.

The Ainstein AI Altimeter is a small form factor device that reports reliable measurements up to 50m. The US-D1 comes with a Molex (50579204) 4-pin, 2.54mm connector. This connector required a modification in order for us to use it with the 8 position automotive connector. 
 
Verify that the following parameters are used on the Flight Controller:
- CAN_P2_DRIVER = 1 (first can port driver set to driver 1)
- CAN_D2_PROTOCOL = 7 (USD1 protocol for driver 1)
- RNGFND1_TYPE = 33 (USD1_CAN)
- RNGFND1_MIN_CM = 50
- RNGFND1_MAX_CM = 4500
- RNGFND1_GNDCLEAR = 10 or more accurately the distance in centimeters from the range finder to the ground when the vehicle is landed. This value depends on how you have mounted the rangefinder.


It is important to note that the altimeter should not be tested in doors to get accurate readings. Please test the altimeter outside and verify that the distance being read is correct.

[Relay](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LW15A4W/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

A relay is used to control the motor inside of the dispenser. 5V and GND provided by PCB. Use the PWM 1 output on the PCB to send the signal from the flight controller to close the relay. The mottor was connected using the COM and NO pins on the relay. This left the motor in an off state by default.

- Connection from the Power PCB to the attachment interface for the brush bullet dispenser relied on self soldering heatshrink . This was mainly done to allow a conenction from a 20 AWG cable to 24 AWG cable. Some lines were doubled up to account for the higher current needs with a smaller cable. The following cable scheme was used:

  - 12V
    - 3 cables for positive
        -Green, Blue, and Yellow
    - 2 cables for negative
        - Orange and White
  - 5V
    - Red for Positive
    - Black for negative
  - Signal
    - Brown

# 8. **Geometry & Structure**

The design of this aircraft centers on accommodating frequent modifications and upgrades, preserving straightforward access to all key components. By employing a modular architecture and standardized interface points, the system can be quickly reconfigured or expanded to integrate novel sensors, payloads, or propulsion elements. Structural integrity is achieved through robust materials such as aluminum 7075 and 3D-printed carbon fiber nylon and connections that distribute loads uniformly. This approach enables the prototype to withstand potentially harsh landings, while finite element analysis (FEA) helps validate each subsystem’s load-bearing capacity. Furthermore, by minimizing mass through efficient structural layouts and selective material use, the aircraft maintains better flight performance, high agility, and reduced power consumption to extend operational times.

---

## 8.1. Overall Geometry

The overall geometry is largely symmetrical, with key components arranged around a central thrust plane. The battery is intentionally placed slightly above this plane, shifting the center of gravity (CG) upward. During mission, lower-mounted attachments help balance the airframe, ensuring that the CG remains near the thrust plane’s center. This symmetrical configuration, combined with the modular design, makes it straightforward to reposition or replace entire subsystems while preserving stable flight characteristics.

Below is a summary of the aircraft’s key dimensional parameters:

| **Parameter**           | **Measurement** |
| ----------------------- | --------------- |
| Folded Width            | 62 cm           |
| Folded Length           | 60 cm           |
| Unfolded Width          | 95 cm           |
| Unfolded Length         | 95 cm           |
| Overall Height          | 68 cm           |
| Max Attachment Height   | 40 cm           |
| Max Attachment Diameter | 30 cm           |

These dimensions ensure balanced weight distribution in both folded and unfolded states while providing adequate space for payloads and accessories.

## 8.2. Detailed Zones

### Main Chassis

Two parallel aluminum plates—each 3/32" (2.5 mm) thick and fabricated from aluminum 7075—form the central chassis of the aircraft. These plates provide the main structural backbone. They're connected by the motor mounts on the corners and a 3D-printed carbon fiber nylon cube clamped at the center. The center cube accommodates holes on the sides to leave access for the attachment harness.

---

### Motors

Each motor is situated at the end of a 30 cm-long, 30 mm-diameter carbon fiber arm that extends radially from the central chassis. These arms are attached to the plates using hinged, foldable connectors made of aluminum. The hinging mechanism typically includes a locking pin, which secures the arms in flight position and allows rapid folding for compact transport. The motor mounts are supplied by the motor manufacturer, embedded around the motor.

---

### Landing Gear

The landing gear system employs 20 mm-diameter carbon fiber tubes attached with off-the-shelf aluminum housing under the central chassis. Two vertical tubes are connected to one horizontal tube on the bottom with aluminum tube connectors. The tubes position the aircraft at a large ground clearance, giving enough height for any attachments.

---

### Battery Enclosure

Located near the geometric center of the aircraft, the battery enclosure ensures a balanced center of gravity for stable flight control. This enclosure is dimensioned to accommodate the selected battery module, as well as batteries in the same battery family with lower capacity.

**Enclosure Structure:**

- A 3D-printed carbon fiber nylon box that attaches directly to the upper chassis plate. It also provides two sliders for the battery, ensuring that the vertical movement is prevented.
- A 3D-printed carbon fiber nylon hatch on the enclosure, protecting the battery from exterior. A cut-out ensures visibility for the battery on-off button and battery charge indicator.
- A 3D-printed carbon fiber nylon cap over the enclosure, featuring integrated cut-outs for ventilation and weight reduction.

---

### Electrical Compartment

The electrical compartment consolidates the power distribution board (PDB), battery connector, and high-voltage and signal cables between the electrical and propulsion system components. The battery connector is located on a connector stand, which has a latch to lock the battery in place. By placing the electrical compartment between the main chassis plates, the design makes the overall size of the aircraft smaller and simplifies cable routing. The PDB and battery connector are removable for any troubleshooting or replacement.

---

### Avionic Bay

The avionic bay houses core navigation and control components, including flight controllers, GPS antennas, and telemetry antenna. By isolating these critical electronics from power systems, the design maintains cleaner data signals and more accurate sensor readings. The avionics are placed on the top of the battery enclosure.

---

### Underside Equipment

The underside of the aircraft provides a dedicated zone for mounting the attachment, radar altimeter, and the gimbal camera. The attachment is connected to an interface utilizing a quick release mechanism. The interface is connected to the chassis for better structural support. The gimbal camera is located on a 3D-printed holder to increase the view angle. The radar altimeter is placed so that the operational field of view is not affected by the attachment and the landing gear.


### 8.3 FEA analysis

Will demonstrate how the structure will behave under the following forces

- 12 Kg of force acting at each motor (full throttle)

- 12 kg of force acting on the cockpit (weight from all equipment)

- The materials in the study are:
  - Aluminum 6061 for all the foldable motor arm connector, landing gear joints, and motor beam ends.
  - Aluminum 7075 for cockpit plates
  - Carbon fiber for the motor arms and land legs.

**NOTE** Structure is constrained at a “imaginary” plate added in the middle to simulate a solid structure with free movement.

### Displacement

### Stress 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69b82e52-3998-4c1c-b71e-9e7cb1ae806e)

### Results Summary
- The results yielded a 1.53 safety factor, meaning that the design at full throttle is marginal and could fail if external forces (bad weather, unexpected maneuvers) are acting.

- The max displacement of one of the motor beams reached 10.77 mm

- The max stress occurred at the motor beam to foldable motor arm connector with a value of 17 Mpa.

**Recommendation:** Since these were the results at full throttle, it is unlikely we will be in this condition. The recommendation is to perform a bench test on the motor arm in order to see how it behaves under various throttle outputs.
